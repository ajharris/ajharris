## About Me

I'm currently working on my Showbase application, an event management, crew scheduling, and expense tracking application. Previously I worked on a C++ application for medical image registration using ITK (Image Toolkit), a MATLAB application using Marching Cubes to define the path of the internal and carotid arteries in stroke patients using CT Angiography with contrast, and the control application for an LED solar simulator.
