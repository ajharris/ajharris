# About Me
I’m currently focused on building applications at the intersection of **data science, machine learning, and full-stack development**. Active projects include:

- **Distributed-ML** - CT Preprocessing Pipeline with Dask This repository implements a distributed, dataset-agnostic CT preprocessing pipeline designed for large clinical imaging datasets  
- **EVXchange** – a prototype platform for peer-to-peer EV charging coordination and energy sharing.  
- **YesChef GPT** – an AI-powered recipe generator that tailors ingredients, preparation steps, and notes to user preferences.  
- **Knock-Em-Dead Resume** – a career-building tool that generates impactful, action-oriented resume statements aligned with data science and ML roles.  

My previous projects span scientific computing and research applications:

- A **C++ application for medical image registration** using ITK (Insight Toolkit).  
- A **MATLAB tool with Marching Cubes** for tracing carotid arteries in stroke patients via CT Angiography.  
- A **control system for an LED solar simulator** supporting research in solar panel technology.  

I combine a background in **medical physics, scientific programming, and AV production** with current work in **data-driven application design** — aiming to deliver tools that are technically rigorous, reliable, and user-focused.
