# About Me
I’m currently focused on building applications at the intersection of **data science, machine learning, and full-stack development**. Active projects include:

- **GitHub-to-LinkedIn Poster** – automates professional updates by posting repository activity directly to LinkedIn.  
- **Showbase** – an event management platform with crew scheduling and expense tracking features.  
- **CommonGround** – a coordination tool for multi-tenant buildings that integrates calendars, Trello, and AI-generated workflows.  
- **Quorix** – an AI-powered app that synthesizes audience questions during live events from chat and QR code inputs.  
- **EVXchange** – a prototype platform for peer-to-peer EV charging coordination and energy sharing.  
- **YesChef GPT** – an AI-powered recipe generator that tailors ingredients, preparation steps, and notes to user preferences.  
- **Knock-Em-Dead Resume** – a career-building tool that generates impactful, action-oriented resume statements aligned with data science and ML roles.  

My previous projects span scientific computing and research applications:

- A **C++ application for medical image registration** using ITK (Insight Toolkit).  
- A **MATLAB tool with Marching Cubes** for tracing carotid arteries in stroke patients via CT Angiography.  
- A **control system for an LED solar simulator** supporting research in solar panel technology.  

I combine a background in **medical physics, scientific programming, and AV production** with current work in **data-driven application design** — aiming to deliver tools that are technically rigorous, reliable, and user-focused.
